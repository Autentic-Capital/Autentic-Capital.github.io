## Autentic DAO: Mersin House Token #1

Real Estate Participation via Blockchain
Date: July 2025

Prepared by: Autentic Global

# 1. Introduction
Autentic DAO: Mersin House Token #1 is the first in a series of real-world real estate participation projects enabled through blockchain-based digital tokens. The project offers a new way to engage with real estate‚Äîone that is transparent, decentralized, and accessible through a user-friendly digital experience provided by Autentic Ltd.
Participants can gain access to the ongoing financial performance of a real apartment in Mersin, Turkey, and play a direct role in governance decisions relating to that property. Through a single, unified token, users receive both operational transparency and the ability to influence key decisions ‚Äî along with income rights based on the property's performance.
This whitepaper outlines the structure, purpose, and participation model of the project in clear and friendly terms.

# 2. Project Overview

Autentic DAO: Mersin House Token #1 centers on a real apartment located in Mersin, Turkey. The property is professionally managed and leased on a long-term residential basis.
What makes this project unique is that participants engage through a single token that provides access to both DAO governance and participation in rental-based distributions generated by the property. This unified model ensures simplicity, full transparency, and a strong alignment of incentives between token holders and property performance.
The project is fully non-custodial: all tokens are held directly by participants in their own wallets. The experience is designed to take less than 15 minutes from signup to activation.

# 3. Token Structure

Autentic DAO: Mersin House Token #1 is built around a single-token model, designed to unify governance rights and income participation in one digital asset.
Token: Autentic DAO: Mersin House Token #1
Purpose: Combined governance + financial participation
Symbol: AMT-MRS01
Supply: 125,000
Price: $1.00 (in USDT)
Blockchain: Polygon (ERC-20)
Functions:
Participate in DAO voting (via Snapshot or on-chain governance tools)
Submit or support proposals (e.g., maintenance, upgrades, property sale)
Receive a monthly share of rental-based income (in USDT)
Entitled to proportional share of sale proceeds if the property is liquidated
Unlock bonuses and ecosystem access in future Autentic projects
Access full reporting, updates, and enhancements via the platform

Legal Classification:
Hybrid token representing economic participation and governance utility. Income participation is based on a private legal agreement. The token is not a security and does not confer legal ownership rights in the underlying real estate.

# 4. How It Works
A participant visits the Autentic Market and purchases one or more AMT-MRS01 tokens.
Each token grants:


A vote in DAO governance
A proportional share of net rental income (distributed monthly in USDT)
Eligibility for final proceeds if the property is sold


Tokens are held non-custodially in the participant‚Äôs wallet.
Voting and distributions occur on-chain, fully automated.
The project concludes upon a DAO vote to sell the property, followed by final income distribution.


5. The Real Estate Property
Location: Mersin, Turkey
Property Type: Residential apartment
Valuation: $125,000
Status: Rented under long-term lease
Management: Operated by a licensed third-party management company under contractual agreement
Rental Distribution: Managed through an on-chain smart contract and a legal rental income assignment


Participants will be able to view full documentation and media assets (photos, video, management details, and historical rental data) on the Autentic platform.
6. Governance Model
All governance activity takes place through the Autentic DAO: Mersin House Token #1 (AMT-MRS01). Decision-making power is decentralized, and every token includes one vote.
Voting Rights:
One token = one vote
Proposals may include: property upgrades, maintenance, changes in management, or asset sale decisions
Voting is conducted via Snapshot or similar on-chain platforms
All votes and outcomes are transparently recorded and published


Proposal Rights:
All token holders may submit or sponsor proposals
Minimum thresholds and procedures are defined in the governance framework


7. Legal Framework
Autentic DAO: Mersin House Token #1 is structured for maximum transparency and regulatory clarity, combining governance and income rights under a single token.
The token does not represent legal ownership of the property
Income rights are defined via a private Rental Income Participation Agreement
Proceeds are assigned to token holders through a Rental Income Assignment Agreement
Token sale proceeds are held in a non-custodial treasury controlled by the DAO
Autentic Global never takes custody of user funds or controls wallets
AML/CTF compliance is performed through KYT monitoring of incoming transactions
No KYC is required during the pilot phase


8. Technology & Security
The system is powered by audited smart contracts and modern Web3 tooling.
ERC-20 token contract for AMT-MRS01
Automated income distribution via rental flow escrow
Snapshot-based DAO voting integration
Token dashboard with wallet-based portfolio, vote history, and reports
Supported wallets: MetaMask, WalletConnect-compatible wallets
Payments accepted: USDT (ERC-20), bank cards (via Wert)
Smart contract audits will be published on the platform before launch


9. Participant Journey
Visit the Autentic Market and connect a wallet
Acquire AMT-MRS01 tokens using USDT
Begin receiving monthly rental income distributions
Vote on governance proposals
If the DAO votes to sell the asset, net proceeds are distributed to token holders
Project lifecycle concludes; tokens become inactive for this asset


10. Project Lifecycle & Exit Conditions
This project has a clear lifecycle. If the DAO votes by majority to sell the property:
The real estate is sold under the DAO‚Äôs approved terms
All net proceeds are distributed to AMT-MRS01 token holders
DAO governance is closed for this project
The project is marked as concluded


This creates clarity and ensures accountability for all participants.
